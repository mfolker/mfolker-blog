This blog is concerned with software engineering. It is intended to act as a record of the areas I am exploring as part of my work and personal interests. It will include, but will not be limited to:

- OAuth 2.0.
- Open ID Connect
- Auth0
- Active Directory
- Enterprise Architecture
- AWS
- CI/CD
- Artificial intelligence. 

The blog code is available at [github.com](https://github.com/mfolker/mfolker-blog). 

The blog code is developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I use Windows and I like environment consistency so I use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to develop it as you will see [here](https://github.com/mfolker/mfolker-blog/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).
